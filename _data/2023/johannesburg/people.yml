This research was inspired by the prevalent institutional culture that subjects women to many forms of systemic forms of discrimination, which prevents their ascension into decision making roles and positions of influence. 

As an aspiring leader and expert in her field, Zintathu has worked as a research lead and development consultant in diverse economic sectors, providing valuable insights to stakeholders such as government, private sector and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs). This informs her well-rounded approach in managing projects, conducting research, and analysing complex data into valuable insights. In 2020, Zintathu started her own consulting firm that provides advisory services to through market research, and she has been operating independently for almost three years now. Her major achievements in entrepreneurship thus far include being accepted into a Business Acceleration Programme in 2023 and breaking out into international markets by landing an American NGO as a client."
