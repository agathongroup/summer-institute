- name: Adrianna Jezierska
  bio: "My name is Adrianna, and I am in the first year of PhD at the University of Bristol, researching online climate-diet discourse of online vegan communities. I am particularly interested in exploring (i) how various actors create opinions on vegan and plant-based diets in the context of climate change and (ii) to what extent they influence their social networks. This project will use a mixed-method approach, including computational social science (NLP, topic modelling), network theory and qualitative interviews. Prior to joining the PhD programme, I earned an MRes in Sustainable Futures from the University of Bristol and a BSc in Marketing from the University of Southampton. I also have a wide-ranging experience in (sci)communications, working previously in public administration for sustainability and climate action, public policy and NGOs. Whilst not at my desk, I enjoy tennis, cooking, long walks in the forest and pilates."

- name: Muhammad Muhammad
  bio: "I am a master’s student in political science at the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in water and environmental engineering at Cairo University (Egypt), and then obtained my PhD in civil engineering with a focus on water resources at the University of Texas at Austin (USA). I eventually decided to direct and adapt the quantitative analytical skills obtained from my engineering studies to tackling political and societal problems, and I am currently employed as a research assistant at the Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES) as part of the PARFORM project (Partnership Formation in the Context of Recent Refugee Migration). In our research we investigate the question of whether the newly arrived refugee migrants in Germany would consider forming partnerships with the majority population? Or would they search for partners in their country of origin, or among the established ethnic minorities? How would members of the majority and from established immigrant groups perceive and react to partnership attempts of newcomers? Finally, when I am not spending time worrying about democratic backsliding or social cohesion in multi-ethnic liberal democracies, I like to read (especially the philosophy of Nietzsche), go cycling, and discover interesting restaurants!"
