      bio: "Natasha Quadlin is an Associate Professor of Sociology at UCLA. Her research examines social inequality in the contemporary United States, with an emphasis on inequality in access and returns to education. She is particularly interested in using large-scale experiments and surveys to examine the mechanisms behind inequalities in schools, families, and labor markets. Other projects use experimental methods to examine public attitudes, and how these attitudes are linked with inequalities on account of gender, social class, race, and other characteristics."

      bio: "Nanum Jeon is a Ph.D. student of Sociology and M.S. student of Statistics at UCLA. She is also a student affiliate of the California Center for Population Research. Nanum Jeon specializes in the areas of social stratification and gender inequality. Her research interests include (1) how disruptive events, such as job displacement, influence individuals, paying close attention to their labor market outcomes; (2) how social conditions, particularly cultural norms and the division of household labor, shape gender ideology and inequality; and (3) causal inference, quantitative and computational methods."
