  bio: "I am an economist who studies digitization and search and matching markets. I've written papers on topics such as the design of Airbnb’s search and matching algorithm, reputation systems, online job search, and 401(k) contribution choices by workers. I am currently an assistant professor of marketing at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. My research has been published in both economics journals (American Economic Review, The Review of Economics and Statistics) and computer science conferences (ACM-EC). I've provided expert input about the digital economy at the President’s Council on Science and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission. Prior to BU, I was a postdoc at the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT. I worked as a data scientist at Airbnb while completing a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University. In my free time, I climb, write, and make a podcast."

- name: Moshe Hoffman
  image: /2019/boston/images/mhoffman.jpg
  bio: "Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the MIT Media Lab Human Dynamics Group and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics. Moshe applies game theory, models of learning and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious) motives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies. Together with Erez Yoeli, he co-designed and teaches  'Game Theory and Social Behavior' which lays out this approach. Moshe obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago."

  bio: "I am a research scientist at MIT Sloan School of Management. My work lies at the intersection of computational and social sciences. My interest includes misinformation, social media, social networks, and cooperation. In particular, I study how our cognition relates to our behavior on online social media. I use theoretical models based on (evolutionary) Game Theory, Network Science, and empirical (data-driven) models based on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Online Experiments. Prior to joining MIT, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Psychology at Yale. I received my PhD in Engineering with a minor in Business Intelligence and Analytics, my Masters in Management, and my undergraduate in Engineering. I also worked as a Systems and Software Integration Lead for five years prior to starting my PhD."

- name: Brooke Foucault Welles
  image: /2019/boston/images/bwelles.jpg
  bio: "Brooke Foucault Welles is an Associate Professor in the department of Communication Studies and core faculty of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. Combining the methods of network science with theories from the social sciences, Foucault Welles studies how online communication networks enable and constrain behavior, with particular emphasis on how these networks facilitate the pursuit of individual, team, and collective goals. Much of her work is interdisciplinary and collaborative, with co-authors from computer science, political science, digital humanities, design, and public health. Her recent contributions include a series of studies of the transformative power of networked counterpublics, techniques for the longitudinal analysis of communication networks using event-based network analysis, and guidelines for the effective use of network visualizations in scientific and lay publications. Her work is funded by grants from the US Army Research Office and US Army Research Lab, and has been featured in leading social science journals such as the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication and Society, and The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. She serves on the editorial board of the journal Web Science and was part of the team that developed the Network Literacy Essential Concepts and Core Ideas."
