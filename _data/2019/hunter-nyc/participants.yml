  progress among students attending a public alternative high school. Hannah is currently exploring the evidence base and 
  implementation of technology-enhanced interventions for youth suicidality. She is specifically interested in understanding 
  who uses text-based message hotlines to address suicidality and how these crisis interventions can be better adapted for 
  hard-to-reach and minority youth populations. Hannah would also like to gain skills in computational science in order to 
  analyze large-scale datasets and hotline conversations. Hannah enjoys practicing yoga, traveling, and spending time with 
  her partner and their four cats."

  and outcomes of care with an emphasis on maintaining cost-effectiveness through high-value care. One of his current 
  projects uses textual analysis to examine healthcare documents using NLP methods. Another project studies the linguistic 
  and paralinguistic features of patient-provider communication to assess how these dynamic interactions drive outcomes 
  (i.e. compliance with complex care regiments; patient experiences of respect, dignity, and satisfaction with care). 
  This fall, he will be applying to doctoral programs in Health Policy and Management, where he hopes to focus on health 
  services research while integrating emerging quantitative and computational methods such as machine learning, 
  causal inference, and automated text analysis."
