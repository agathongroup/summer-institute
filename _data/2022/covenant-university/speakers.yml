  bio: "<p align='justify'>Édith Darin has been mapping and estimating population for the WorldPop research group at the University of Southampton since 2018. She developed tailored advanced statistical models to tackle outdated or incomplete population count mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. She led collaborations with the Burkina Faso and the Mali Statistics offices to fill the gaps in their census (2020 and 2022) caused by security challenges. To ensure open knowledge transfer she developed a one-week course on Bayesian population model for census support in close partnership with UNFPA and the Brazilian Statistics Office. Her work has been featured in several peer-reviewed publications (Remote Sensing, Nature Communications, Gates Open Research) and relayed by different institutions (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GRID3, French Institute for Demography, UNFPA). Her background is in Statistics (Paris Graduate School of Economics, Statistics, and Finance), social sciences (École Normale Supérieure) and geographic systems (University of Southampton).</p>"

He holds a Ph.D from the University of the Witwatersrand in the field of behavioural finance and is extensively involved in both academia and practice, as evidenced by regular media engagements, memberships in societies and awards. <br/><br/> Yudhvir's area of focus is on the application of empirical (analytical) techniques to finance (broadly defined as both investments and corporate finance), with an emphasis on incorporating investor psychology/biases into these techniques. Interest in this field is relatively scarce in South Africa, but there has been growth over the past decade. While this area may seem broad, the underlying theme is on applying inter-disciplinary approaches in solving traditional problems in the financial field. As such, there are neighbouring applications in the field of Financial Technology (such as “big data” and “data science”) and in risk management. <br/><br/> He has published extensively in local and international journals, such as the Investment Analysts Journal, International Journal of Emerging Markets, Eurasian Business Review, inter alia. Yudhvir is an Editorial Board member of the Journal of Business Analytics; an Editor for Cogent Economics and Finance and Springer Nature: Business and Economics.
