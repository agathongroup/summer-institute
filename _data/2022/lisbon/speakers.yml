  bio: "Dr. Jinjun Xiong is an Empire Innovation Professor with the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University at Buffalo (UB) . He received his Ph.D. degree in 2006 from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with an Outstanding Ph.D. Award, his M.S. degree from University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2002, and his M.S. and B.S. degrees from Tsinghua University in 2000 and 1998, respectively. Before joining UB in 2021, Dr. Xiong was Program Director and Senior Research Scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. Dr. Xiong also co-founded the IBM Smarter Energy Research Institute and led a number of enterprise-scale collaborations with world-wide electric utility companies to address sustainability issues with renewable integration. He has published more than 150 peer-reviewed papers in top AI conferences and systems conferences. His publication has won seven Best Paper Awards and eight Nominations for Best Paper Awards. Dr. Xiong also won top awards from various international competitions, including the recent Championship Award for the IEEE GraphChallenge on accelerating sparse neural networks, and the Championship Awards for the DAC'19 Systems Design Contest on designing an object detection neural network for both edge FPGA track and the edge GPU track. Many of his research results have been adopted in commercial enterprise-scale products and tools. "

  title: "Accelerating AI Systems Innovations to Democratize AI for a better Society"
  abstract: "AI has become an increasingly powerful technology force that will transform different aspects of our society, such as transportation, healthcare, education, and scientific discovery.  But the diverse layers of software abstractions, hardware heterogeneity, privacy and security concerns, and big-data driven machine learning models have made the development of optimized AI solutions extremely challenging. This results in the business world’s expensive investment only on a handful of selective and “profitable” AI solutions, leaving many critical societal needs, such as equitable education and sustainability, much less addressed than deserved. To truly democratize the power of AI for the benefit of the society and humanity, AI systems innovation, driven by “earthly” AI solutions involving big data, AI models, and hybrid cloud computing infrastructures, holds the key to drastically simplify the development of AI solutions and greatly improve AI productivity at a lower cost. This talk will discuss some of my related research efforts in the past decade on developing enterprise-scale high performance AI solutions and innovating related AI systems technologies, in particular, a data-driven reviewer recommendation AI solution, automation tools to identify system performance bottlenecks, and innovative software-hardware co-optimization algorithms for accelerating AI algorithms.  I will contextualize these efforts in an ultimate research goal of transforming the current computing paradigm with AI systems innovation to truly democratize AI for a better society."
