  bio: "Ridhi Kashyap is associate professor of social demography at the University of Oxford and professorial fellow at Nuffield College. At Oxford, she also leads the strand on digital and computational demography within the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science. Her research covers questions linked to mortality and health, gender inequality, marriage and family, and migration, and the implications of digital transformations on demographic and development outcomes. Beyond these substantive interests, she is also methodologically interested in the applications of new sources of data, such as those generated by the use of the internet and mobile technologies, and computational methods for population research."
