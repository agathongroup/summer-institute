  bio: "Eszter is a research postdoc in the POPNET project investigating a population-scale social network of the Netherlands. She has a background in physics and graduated with a PhD from statistical physics at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. The topic of her thesis was already rather connected to computational social science, having investigated a huge database of geolocated Twitter messages. She is still mostly interested in spatial social networks and their connection to human mobility, as well as dynamic phenomena such as the spreading of innovations over these social networks."

  bio: "Wouter is a leading computational communication scientist, developing and using state of the art computational communication science techniques. Combining these computational techniques with traditional panel survey methods allows studying the effect of individual media diets, for example in the recent Dutch parliamentary elections. Wouter is an interdisciplinary scientist by training, having received his M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and a joint Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Communication Science from the VU Amsterdam. Wouter is a leading Communication Science Scholar who co-founded and chaired the Computational Methods division in the international scientific association ICA. He founded and is editor-in-chief of a new open access journal called Computational Communication Research published by Amsterdam University Press and sponsored by multiple international universities."
