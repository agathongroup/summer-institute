- name: Pavel Goldstein
  bio: "I have completed , Master in Biostatistics and PhD in pain neuroscience. During my PhD studies, I was exposed to the field of pain research that is still overflowed with endless debates about basic questions: how we measure pain? What causes pain? How we treat pain? Completing graduate studies I found myself at the Prof. Tor Wager’s lab, leading projects with a focus on digital solutions for chronic pain. In 2019 I founded Integrative Pain Laboratory at the University of Haifa to gather novel understanding of chronic pain conditions, developing new ways of measuring, preventing and treating chronic pain."

- name: Daphna Canetti
  bio: I am a professor of political psychology and the Dean of the Herta and Paul Amir Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Haifa. My research focuses on the micro-foundations of political conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere. I am particularly interested in the impact of individual-level exposure to cyber-terrorism and political violence on war/peace attitudes. I study psycho-political responses to multiple acts of political violence and terrorism. Methodologically, I use controlled randomized field experiments, spatial analysis, survey experiments, bio-political and physiological-political research.
