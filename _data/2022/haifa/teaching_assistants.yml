  bio: I am currently completing my master’s degree in statistics at Haifa University. I have vast experience as a teaching assistant for a dozen courses in the university’s statistics department. These have varied from courses in probability and statistical theory to machine learning, statistical modeling and programming in Python and R. I also have experience helping social scientists to conceptualize, collect and analyze the statistical data they need for their research.
