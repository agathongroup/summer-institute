  bio: "Oriol J. Bosch is a PhD candidate at the Department of Methodology at the London School of Economics. He is also a non-resident research fellow at the Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM – Universitat Pompeu Fabra). As a methodologist, Oriol focuses on understanding how to better collect and analyse attitudinal and behavioural data for the social sciences. He specialises in topics related to measurement quality, web and mobile surveys and the use of digital trace data and sensors/apps to enhance or substitute surveys, and the effect of these on data quality. His work has explored the impact on data quality of using novel data types to answer survey questions as images, voice memos and emojis. For his PhD, Oriol is developing and applying new methodologies to assess the errors of web tracking data and compare these with the ones of surveys."

- name: Douglas Leasure
  image: /assets/images/doug_leasure.jpg
  bio: "Doug’s research spans human demography, population ecology, geosciences, and Bayesian statistics. He develops novel methods to map populations and demographics with high spatial resolution using sparse survey data while accounting for uncertainty in population estimates to support informed decision-making for census support, government services, and global health initiatives. His interdisciplinary research combines powerful analytical approaches in human demography and population ecology with exciting new geospatial data derived from household surveys and space-based Earth observation platforms. To promote research with real-world impacts, Doug is committed to open science and develops web applications that translate scientific results into easy-to-navigate interactive maps and tools to facilitate uptake by stakeholders globally."
