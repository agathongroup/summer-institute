- name: Douglas Leasure
  image: /assets/images/doug_leasure.jpg
  bio: "Doug’s research spans human demography, population ecology, geosciences, and Bayesian statistics. He develops novel methods to map populations and demographics with high spatial resolution using sparse survey data while accounting for uncertainty in population estimates to support informed decision-making for census support, government services, and global health initiatives. His interdisciplinary research combines powerful analytical approaches in human demography and population ecology with exciting new geospatial data derived from household surveys and space-based Earth observation platforms. To promote research with real-world impacts, Doug is committed to open science and develops web applications that translate scientific results into easy-to-navigate interactive maps and tools to facilitate uptake by stakeholders globally."
