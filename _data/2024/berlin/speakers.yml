  bio: "Sophia Hunger is professor of Computational Social Sciences at the University of Bremen and research fellow at the Center for Civil Society Research. Until April 2023 she was a postdoctoral researcher at the Center and involved in a research project on protest and political radicalization in Germany, after receiving her doctorate from the European University Institute in 2020. Her research focuses on protest movements, political engagement, party competition, political communication, and applied quantitative methods, particularly quantitative text analysis and automated event extraction. Currently, her largest methodological undertaking is the automatization of Protest Event Analysis with cutting-edge methods in order to facilitate research on how protest shapes and affects modern societies. She is furthermore interested in developing new methods to measure positions, polarization, and resonance in political communication and public debate.
