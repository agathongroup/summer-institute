- name: Andreu Casas
  bio: "Andreu Casas is an Assistant Professor in Political Communication at Royal Holloway University of London in the Department of Politics, International Relations and Philosophy, and a Faculty Associate in the Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University. He is a computational political scientist working on political communication, public policy, legislative politics, and computational methods. The substantive goal of his research is to build a better understanding of the policymaking process, broadly speaking, in the current digital society. His research in political communication and public policy looks at how social media has shaped collective action dynamics; how social movements, interest groups, political parties, as well as the public, use public communications to influence the political agenda; the role of (social) media in increasing/ameliorating polarization; and the regulation of political speech by social media companies. His research on legislative politics looks at the conditions under which individual legislators and legislative groups influence policy through less prominent (e.g. amendments) and more informal (e.g. bundling legislation) mechanisms. He develops and/or applies novel computation methods (text-as-data and images-as-data) that allows to unlock important (classic and new) research questions that cannot be addressed otherwise."

His research focuses on protest, interest groups, and elite behaviour with a comparative approach in Europe and Latin America. He works with computational linguistics, social network analysis and experimental methods. His most recent projects study public attitudes and elite responsiveness to protest, affective polarization, and public emotions in contentious times. He was a post-doctoral research fellow at the Centre for European Studies at Sciences Po, Paris, and has collaborated with different government institutions on policy implementation and evaluation projects. His work in political communication, political sociology, and political science has been published in Europe, the US and Latin America."

- name: Andreu Rodilla
  bio: "Andreu Rodilla is a PhD candidate at University of Barcelona (UB) and at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). His research focuses at the intersection of judicial politics and legislative studies. In particular, he studies how courts influence the legislative process from an empirical perspective. In this sense, he analyses legislative and legal text from a quantitative point of view."

- name: Luis Remiro
  bio: "Luis Remiro is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political Science at the University of Barcelona. His research primarily explores political behaviour, political culture, and quantitative research methods, with a special focus on affective polarisation and voters' attitudes towards institutions. He examines the factors driving affective polarisation in Latin America, including elite behaviour, the role of leaders in shaping political identities, and how democratic backsliding can drive affective polarisation. Additionally, he regularly contributes to various media outlets (online, radio, and television) and forums to discuss Venezuelan politics and electoral behaviour."
