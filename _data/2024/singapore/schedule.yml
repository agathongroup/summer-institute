The evidence of social networks to identify who has good ideas, who is influential, and what teams will get work done efficiently and effectively is well established. The challenge has been collecting network data via time-consuming surveys, which elicit low response rates and have high obsolescence. This talk presents empirical examples to demonstrate how we can leverage people analytics to mine data created by individuals in their digital transactions to address challenges they face with issues such as team assembly and team conflict.*"

In this workshop, we will focus on the analysis of online reviews, a common form of raw text, through two focused tutorials. Each session begins with an empirical study to ground our exploration. The first tutorial covers sentence-level sentiment analysis, which provides insights into how sentiments are expressed across different parts of a text. The second tutorial advances to a more targeted analysis of sentiments associated with specific aspects within a text (e.g., sentiment related to food or service, or the environment in a restaurant review). This approach not only helps understand individual-level motives but also explores macro-level phenomena that offer a comprehensive view of communication behaviors as they manifest online.*"

In the first project, a network analysis approach is employed to investigate the citation and co-citation network behind fact-checking content in the United States, revealing the selective way online fact-checkers cites sources. The second project analyzes the value and regulation systems embedded within the public-facing policies (community guidelines) of media platforms through lexical analysis and network analysis. Using digital datasets that are not commonly employed in communication research, the findings of these two projects aims to understand the complexity of media platforms and the impact on their audiences.*"

The quantitative analysis of social networks has become increasingly systematized over the years, and is now widely considered a mature and frontline discipline in the study of human behaviour. This talk will introduce participants to foundational concepts, methods and a few relevant studies concerning the analysis of dynamic social networks – focusing particularly on the challenge of inferring causal relationships in large networks using both experimental and non-experimental approaches. We will conclude with a brief discussion on some of the emerging challenges and untapped research opportunities in this space.*"

He will also interrogate the meaningfulness of the data and inferences and reflect on how these approaches can potentially be misinterpreted or misused without additional considerations. To bridge the gap between the theoretical promise and practical utility, he will present the importance of evaluating the needs, benefits, and harms of wellbeing sensing technologies in practice. This talk will propel the vision toward questioning the underlying assumptions and in responsible design and deployment of wellbeing sensing technologies (if at all) for situated communities and the future of work.*"

Recent advances in computer vision, deep learning, and large multimodal models have provided researchers with powerful tools for such scalable visual analysis. This talk explores how computational visual analysis enhances our understanding of political communication by showcasing two empirical studies. The first study employs unsupervised image clustering on protest visuals from ten million tweets to understand the role of visual content in three prominent social-mediated protests. The second study examines over five million Douyin videos from over 18,000 regime-affiliated accounts in China, using computer vision methods to uncover a decentralized model of modern propaganda production and dissemination. In addition to demonstrating how computational analysis of visuals can shed light on political processes and outcomes, I will discuss the opportunities, challenges, and future directions for this approach in communication research.*"

In this talk, we present a road map for using LLMs as computational social science tools.  To do so, we first analyze the zero-shot performance of 13 LLMs on 24 representative computational social science benchmarks. We then demonstrate how they can enhance the CSS research pipeline and significantly reduce costs and increase the efficiency of social science analysis. Finally, we outline a few major concerns about the application of LLMs to social sciences, and make recommendations for investments that may help to address them.*"

The talk will introduce three case studies, discuss some behind-the-scene thinking processes, and explore how CSS projects — starting with an interesting research question, or some invaluable data, or an innovative methodological framework — can forge synergy between the three elements to create a research design that tells an engaging social science story.*"
