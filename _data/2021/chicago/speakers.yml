  bio: "James Evans is a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. He is the director of the Knowledge Lab and the founder/director of the Computational Social Science program at UChicago. His research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. You can find his work in Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review and other outlets."

  bio: "Adam Pah is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the Kellogg School of Management and Organizations at Northwestern University. He received his BS from Arizona State University, PhD from Northwestern University, and has worked industrially as a Data Scientist. He is a Co-Principal Investigator of the Systematic Content Analysis of Litigation EventS Open Knowledge Network (SCALES OKN), a NSF funded effort to transform the transparency and accessibility of court records. The SCALES OKN is a public platform that uses AI to surface insights into systematic patterns and behaviors in court records. The project's goal is to make it easy for lawyers, legal scholars, and journalists to transform difficult question about how the courts operate into easily obtainable information and answers. His primary research for the platform centers on building language models to understand how litigation proceeds, disambiguating entities, and quantifying the extent that legal outcomes vary within and between court districts."

  bio: "Kristina Lerman is a Project Leader at the Information Sciences Institute, a unit of the University of Southern California (USC), and a Research Associate Professor in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering's Computer Science Department. An expert in complex multi-agent systems, Dr. Lerman has received numerous grants on social data and other topics from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Information Sciences Institute (ISI) early in her career. Her current work revolves around deciphering the structure and dynamics of social web sites such as Twitter, Digg, Flickr and Delicious. Among her goals: automatically organize collective knowledge, discover the structure of user-generated communities, and predict emerging trends and group behavior. Her empirical and experimental studies identified the importance of cognitive biases to understanding individual and collective behavior online."
