  bio: Fatima Alqabandi is a doctoral student in Sociology at Duke University. She is part of the Polarization Lab, the Duke Network Analysis Center, and, more recently, she has co-founded the Duke Computational Social Science Working Group. Her current projects include running online social experiments to explore self-censorship and political polarization, as well as using agent-based modeling to better understand the dynamics of radicalization. She hopes to continue to integrate computational methods and machine learning into social scientific research.

  bio: Emily Cantrell is a doctoral student in Sociology and Social Policy at Princeton University. She received her bachelor’s degree from Denison University in 2017, where she designed her own major in Human Development and Social Policy with a focus on socioeconomic inequality in the United States. Prior to beginning her graduate work, Emily worked at Child Trends, a research organization that evaluates programs and policies to improve the lives of children and families. Her current projects include a collaboration to assess the predictability of life trajectories using hundreds of machine learning strategies, building on findings from the <a href="https://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/">Fragile Families Challenge</a>.

  bio: Megan Kang is a PhD student in Sociology at Princeton University. She studies the consequences of violence on disadvantaged communities, with the goal of identifying effective and humane ways of reducing inequality in safety and well-being. Prior to joining Princeton, she was a Teach for America corps member in Detroit and then worked on a large-scale RCT aimed at reducing gun violence at the UChicago Crime Lab. Megan is interested in how computational social science can leverage qualitative insights, and is committed to finding ethical applications of AI in public policy. Her current projects involve using in-depth interviews to find out why the Fragile Families Challenge yielded poor predictions of youth outcomes and exploring the use of computer vision on police camera footage.

- name: Lai Wei
  image: /assets/images/Lai_Wei.jpeg
  bio: Lai Wei is a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology, Princeton University. Before coming to Princeton, he attained a BA in sociology from Tsinghua University. Lai’s research interests include social mobility, public opinion, quantitative methodology, and China. One strand of his ongoing research tries to develop new indicators of social mobility and new methods for studying the impact of mobility that borrow insights from machine learning and causal inference. Another continuing line of research of his investigates the landscape, origin, and consequence of public opinion in China using survey, experimental, and social media data. Lai is broadly interested in how to use machine learning to help social science research.
