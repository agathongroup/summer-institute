  bio: "Yuan Yuan is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and will join the Purdue Krannert School of Management (MIS area) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2021. Before coming to MIT, he studied at Tsinghua University where he received Bachelor's degrees with honors in Computer Science and Economics. He researches social interactions and social networks for social good, especially interested in how to utilize social preference and social contagion to promote positive social interactions, and how social networks have shaped human behavior and can be reshaped by digital technologies. His research also aims to advance the methodology in Computational Social Science. He is broadly interested in machine learning, causal inference, experimental design, and network science. Currently, he advocates two research methodologies: complex explanatory models and causal data mining."
