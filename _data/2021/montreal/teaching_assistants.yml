  bio: "Georges Alain Tchango Ngalé is a PhD candidate in demography at the Université de Montréal. He participates in research activities as part of Trajectories of Immigrant Participation in Quebec Society (TrajIPaQ) project in the Department of Demography. His thesis project focuses on the relationship between the health of immigrants and their participation/integration into Quebec society, using a mixed methodological approach. More generally, his heuristic fields of interest focus on population health and gender-based violence, trying to follow as much as possible a cross perspective between life course and intersectionality. He has participated in several international conferences and is the author/co-author of a scientific article and book."
