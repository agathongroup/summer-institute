  bio: "Ridhi Kashyap is an Associate Professor of Social Demography at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. Her research explores the interaction between social inequalities and demographic processes. She is particularly interested in how digital and computational innovations, both as a set of models (e.g agent-based models, microsimulation) and new types of data sources (e.g digital trace data), can contribute to social science. As an example, she has worked with other social and computer scientists to explore how digital trace data can be leveraged to measuredevelopment and gender inequality indicators."
