  bio: "Bunakiye Japheth is a lecturer of  Computer Science at Edo University Iyamho, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics. He  received his PhD from the Computer Science Department at University of Port Harcourt Nigeria. His research focused on the application of domain specific modelling approach to modelling engineering designs in the oil and gas transmission pipeline systems. Much of his work is directed at requirements within a particular domain, where the structure and behaviour of the prototype system capturing stakeholders design intents that depict various design scenarios were examined. His research methodology was hinged on Domain Specific modelling of Model Driven Engineering Technologies that tackles complexities in domains through language formalisms that could be beyond the utilization of stakeholders. This language formalism is simply a reusable software layer that can be tailored to any specific domain through requirements engineering for greater stakeholder output."
