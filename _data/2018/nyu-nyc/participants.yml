- name: Anna Skarpelis
  image: /2018/nyu-nyc/images/anna.jpg
  bio: Anna Skarpelis is completing her PhD in Sociology at New York University and will be joining Harvard University as postdoctoral fellow in the Fall. Her dissertation, Making the Master Race, investigates racial anxiety and the consequences of ethnoracial classification practices in multi-ethnic empires (specifically 20th century Germany and Japan). She is also working on a project that leverages computational text analysis to better understand how sociologists use theoretical concepts in their own work. When she isn't translating obscure Japanese and German texts into English, she likes to read up on political philosophy, the sociology of morality and the philosophy of science. Equipped with a slightly odd sense of humor after years spent in archives researching fascists, she has performed at UCB New York and is writing her first satirical novel on David Thoreau.
