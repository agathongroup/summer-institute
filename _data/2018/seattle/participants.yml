  bio: Roxana is a PhD candidate in Higher Education at the University of Washington - Seattle. She is interested in unmasking how social and economic inequality gets reproduced at emerging economies, looking specifically at the career of doctorate holders, to whom she treats as the most meritocratic "intellectual elite" in the supposed "knowledge society".  To complete this task, Roxana's dissertation has combined multiple sources of national surveys, qualitative interview, and CV data of university professors to identify how meritocratic criteria and social network ascription inform the career outcomes  of university professors in Chile. In the near future, Roxana will apply similar methodology using data from Mexico and South Africa.
