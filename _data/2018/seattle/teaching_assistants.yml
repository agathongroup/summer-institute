  bio: Chuck is a graduate student in the Department of Sociology whose interests lie in the application of novel statistical and computational methods to questions at the intersection of criminology, sociology, and demography. His research agenda focuses on exploring the emergent properties of human social behaviors embedded in dynamic environments. For example, his current projects broadly examine how demographic and built environment characteristics of places influence social control and situational opportunity to determine the distribution of crime in time and place.
