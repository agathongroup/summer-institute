  bio: "I studied Political Science and International Relations at Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey, and took a double major in Sociology at the same university. During my education, I also attended various universities such as The Hague University of Applied Sciences as an Erasmus student, Beijing Language and Culture, and University of Oslo for Comparative Social Science Summer School. I hold a Master at the Department of War Studies at King's College London. During my MA, I worked about peace processes in Turkey by evaluating the socio-political steps in this process by attempting to understand governmental responses and the reactions of terrorist actions. I have been research assistant in the Department of Sociology at Yeditepe University since 2016 where I do my doctoral study. I also studied in the department of Politics and International Relations as recognised student at University of Oxford between 2019-2020 for my doctoral studies. My main research areas are political sociology, terrorism studies, sociology of war and social movements. My doctoral research focuses on exploring the institutional responses and counter-terrorism strategies developed by Turkey and the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, 2003 Istanbul and 2005 London terrorist attacks. I plan to defend my thesis in September 2020."
