  bio: Martina Balestra is a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Technology Management
    & Innovation at New York University advised by Oded Nov. She is broadly interested
    in decentralized online platforms and how many diverse, anonymous, non-communicating
    people can come together to produce complex and high-quality information, artifacts,
    and communities. Her dissertation work tackles questions related to (1) the emergence
    and characterization of complex, dynamic user roles in decentralized and networked
    systems, (2) the structural and motivational determinants of who falls into what
    role, and (3) how individual, localized patterns of engagement give way to global
    system behavior.

    neural activity across the brain that are predictive of individuals' real-world
    social network characteristics. He is also interested in studying how individual
    differences in the use of language and in interpretations of narratives may relate
    to meaningful individual differences in neural activity and social network position.

  bio: I am a 3rd year PhD student in sociology at UCLA interested in examining the
    stratifying effects of immigration policy, in particular legal status categories,
    on the social, economic, and political lives of immigrants and their children.
    My MA thesis examined how legal status shapes the civic participation of Latino
    immigrants in Los Angeles. I hope to apply computational methods to impute legal
    status when such measures are not fully available, gain familiarity with new data
    sources and data collection methods, and disentangle the causal effects of legal
    status acquisition.

- name: Angela Cunningham
  bio: I am a PhD candidate, expecting to graduate in the winter of 2018. My dissertation
    focuses on critical military geographies of rural Americans during and after the
    Great War. Drawing on newly accessible comprehensive individual-level civilian
    and military data, my research employs the techniques of historical demography
    and spatial analysis within a theoretical framework of space-time as relative,
    relational and constitutive to argue that the life courses and relationships of
    individual soldiers bind home and front and necessitate a more nuanced appreciation
    of the far-reaching and persistent effects of militaristic ideologies and practices.
    I have presented portions of my work at the annual meetings of the Social Sciences
    History Association, American Association of Geographers, and the Population Association
    of America. My first sole-authored paper, forthcoming in Historical Methods, explores
    automated record linkage methodologies.

    His dissertation examines the circumstances in which good intervention decisions
    can be made using machine learning models, even if the models are problematic
    for causal-effect estimation. This has important implications because acquiring
    data to estimate causal effects accurately is often complicated and expensive,
    and results are often better when modeling intervention decisions rather than
    causal effects. He has also conducted work studying referrals in the ride-sharing
    industry; the interpretability of data-driven decions made by AI systems; and
    the combination of observational and experimental data to improve the intervention
    decisions made by machine learning models.

- name: Galen Murray
  bio: I’m interested in how corruption and criminal elements impede (or facilitate)
    public service delivery. My dissertation uses a regression discontinuity design
    to estimate the causal impact of 'criminal' politicians on the delivery of state
    resources to citizens in India. To flesh out how local politicians influence benefit
    delivery, I study the geospatial distribution of the world's largest welfare program
    (NREGS in India). Specifically, I'm interested in how local politicians target
    their supporters by mapping the location of 20 million welfare projects to micro-levels
    of political support (estimated from polling station level results). I complement
    this quantitative research with over 12 months of on the ground interviews, with
    politicians, activists and local leaders in Bihar, India. Quantitatively, I’m
    interested in causal inference using observational data.

  bio: I'm an Italian student pursuing a PhD in Econometrics at UCSD. After getting
    my bachelor in Italy, I obtained a Masters in Economics from Cornell University.
    In my current research I focus on robustness procedures for the estimation of
    causal effects when identifying assumptions are doubted. In my applied work, I
    am interested in coupling data and nonparametric methods to inform effective policy
    making in public health. Lately, I have been curious to learn more about how price
    transparency in the health sector effects consumers' choice of provider. In my
    spare time I enjoy reading, chatting about math and philosophy and practicing
    martial arts.

    Disenchanted: The Variety of Individuals that Do Not Travel or Migrate Abroad
    and Why” examines why more people do not travel or into the US. In terms of method,
    I am building and analyzing the first large scale individual-level survey dataset
    about three different types of individuals in China that do not travel or immigrate
    into the US--those that are denied visas, those that are deterred from applying
    for visas and going abroad, and ex-immigrants that previously intended to immigrate
    but then later change their mind and return. In terms of theory, I aim to draw
    on this data to better understand what we already know about immigrants and contribute
    new insights to longstanding perennial questions about migrant selectivity, state
    capacity to control migration and the relationship between social stratification/mobility/inequality
    and international migration and travel.'

    norms? Have these partisan norms changed over time? How do partisan social norms
    affect political attitudes and behaviors? My other major project examines partisan
    dehumanization - an extreme form of affective polarization associated with political

  bio: in Urban Information Systems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My interests
    lie in empirically exploring how digitization unfolds in non-western urban spaces,
    asking what changes, where and for whom? In my research I play with a variety
    of methods, merging spatial analytics, computational social science, field-based
    interviews and embedded observations. For my dissertation project I study the
    transformation of urban mobility markets in Jakarta and Bangkok through the entry
    of digital platforms like GoJek and Grab. Combining the granularity of big data
    and the contextualizing powers of qualitative research, I examine how digital
    workers can create collective structures of solidarity, resist the governance
    regime of the platform and even transform the functioning of the platform. As
    my work shows though these outcomes are not determined or random, but instead
    arise out of complex interactions between possibilities created by technology,
    worker agency and social norms.

    University’s Questrom School of Business. She received her PhD from the Management
    of Organizations Department at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Her research
    examines the role of emotion, cognition, and culture in shaping social networks
    and labor market outcomes. Much of her work is situated in organizational settings,
    where she examine the microfoundations of workplace inequality. Although grounded
    in sociology and organizational theory, her work integrates theoretical insights
    from social psychology and sociolinguistics. Her research methods are similarly
    diverse, ranging from experimental studies in the lab to audit studies in the
    field to computational approaches applied to large archival data sets.

    news from around 800 TV stations across all US Designated Market Areas for a period
    of approximately six years (2012~2018). In a previous study, I investigated the
    co-evolution of attention and content production in online collaborative systems
    such as Wikipedia. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale natural experiment
    to study how exogenous content contributions to a Wikipedia article causally affect
    the attention it attracts and how that attention spills over to other articles
    in the network.

    planning policy. She is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University
    of Colorado Boulder. In her current research, she uses demographic methods to
    study the impacts of reproductive health policies, and computational and qualitative
    methods to study social responses to these policies. At Boulder she leads a team
    using massive administrative data at the Census Bureau to evaluate the life course
    consequences of access to (as opposed to use of) highly effective contraception.
    And she contributes to a variety of ongoing evaluations of reproductive health
    policies and develops new strategies for measuring fertility with administrative
    data. Another line of research examines the social responses to reproductive health
    policies. In a current project, she uses Twitter responses, website content, media
    coverage, and in-depth interviews to examine the social movement response to Texas'
    2013 abortion restrictions. The case provides an opportunity to investigate how
    social movements negotiate intersectional critiques from within their ranks.

    bases of antisocial behavior and related constructs, and includes topics at the

    life events and turning points in life (e.g., marriage) shape antisocial behavior,
    and how environment interacts with individuals’ biological characteristics (e.g.,
    stress system, fear conditioning) to exacerbate or limit antisocial behavior throughout
    the life-course. She employs both psychophysiological recording and salivary bioscience
    research methods in furtherance of this work. Her current research on psychobiological
    and social characteristics of active, noninstitutionalized hardcore street offenders
    is an endeavor to advance our knowledge of the persistence in offending.

    and theoretical frameworks across disciplines and fields, including sociology,
    communication, cultural studies, political science, and computer/information technology.
    Given these interests and her interdisciplinary background, Muyang’s dissertation
    applies mixed-method in exploring the negotiation between the authoritarian state
    and the individual in defining democracy through the social media, and try to
    reveal how the authoritarian regimes survived the ideological crisis in the social
    media era through the combination of repressive and hegemonic media control strategies.'

    his work is directed at requirements within a particular domain, where the structure
    and behaviour of the prototype system capturing stakeholders design intents that
    depict various design scenarios were examined. His research methodology was hinged
    on Domain Specific modelling of Model Driven Engineering Technologies that tackles
    complexities in domains through language formalisms that could be beyond the utilization
    of stakeholders. This language formalism is simply a reusable software layer that
    can be tailored to any specific domain through requirements engineering for greater

    and social network analysis techniques from the computational social sciences
    coupled with multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in Los Angeles, CA and Dharamsala,
    India. His work as a research assistant investigates the potential application
    of computer vision to social science inquiries, specifically looking at the intersection
    between representations of place/neighborhood and their effects on greater urban
    social and economic processes.

  bio: Arran recently finished his DPhil (PhD) at the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary
    Anthropology, University of Oxford, where he was a Clarendon Scholar. He is now
    teaching quantitative methods at both the undergraduate and graduate level at
    Oxford, as well as working part time as a data scientist at TextureAI. Using evolutionary
    theory to understand human behaviour, he has studied the cultural activities that
    lead to bonded, cooperative relationships among humans. Arran's DPhil focused
    on the effects of social relationships on human health and wellbeing. Specifically,
    he used experimental, observational, and 'big data' approaches to understand how
    social support and cohesion can enhance the performance of physical exercise through
    reducing perceptions of pain and fatigue. Particularly relevant to the SICSS,
    he built social networks using data from over 10 million runs at parkrun (a free,
    weekly, community based 5 km run that happens at over 600 locations around the
    world) to demonstrate how the presence of close social relationships can improve
    run times and exercise adherence. Arran is excited to advance his (largely self
    taught) knowledge of the network sciences, web scrapping, Python, and R, especially
    with regard to how these methods and tools can be successfully applied to answering
    the challenges we face as a society.

    and political engagement. His ongoing political work considers the key predictors
    that explain why students change their political orientation over the course of
    college and how students across the political spectrum engage in campus political
    discourse and understand themselves as political actors, particularly in reference
    to students identifying at the other end of the spectrum, and how they develop

- name: Patrick Tenga Shako
  bio: Patrick Tenga Shako is a Junior Lecturer/Teacher Assistant attached to the
    faculty of Computer sciences at the Nouveaux Horizons University and a candidate
    for a postgraduate degree at the University of Lubumbashi. Holder of an honour
    degree from the University of Lubumbashi and a master's degree from the African
    Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Senegal, he has developed a real interest
    for data sciences, numerical analysis and mathematical modelling.  After attending
    schools on big data, computational neuroscience, he acquired a real passion for
    artificial intelligence (Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning). From this,
    he understood that one cannot do data analysis without understanding the domain
    in which these data belong. He expects to specialize in data science and mathematical
    modelling and plans to establish in the coming years an interdisciplinary research
    laboratory in data sciences in order to promote interaction and complementarity
    between different fields.

    mind is all about exposing them to facts that support our views and challenge
    theirs, such an approach may be more likely to engender defensive information
    avoidance rather than receptive information processing.

  bio: I studied Political Science and International Relations at Yeditepe University,
    Istanbul, Turkey, and took a double major in Sociology at the same university.
    During my education, I also attended various universities such as The Hague University
    of Applied Sciences as an Erasmus student, Beijing Language and Culture, and University
    of Oslo for Comparative Social Science Summer School. I hold a Master at the Department
    of War Studies at King's College London. During my MA, I worked about peace processes
    in Turkey by evaluating the socio-political steps in this process by attempting
    to understand governmental responses and the reactions of terrorist actions. I
    have been research assistant in the Department of Sociology at Yeditepe University
    since 2016 where I do my doctoral study. I also studied in the department of Politics
    and International Relations as recognised student at University of Oxford between
    2019-2020 for my doctoral studies. My main research areas are political sociology,
    terrorism studies, sociology of war and social movements. My doctoral research
    focuses on exploring the institutional responses and counter-terrorism strategies
    developed by Turkey and the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks,
    2003 Istanbul and 2005 London terrorist attacks. I plan to defend my thesis in
    September 2020.

  bio: 'Sharon Meraz’s work resides in the interplay of political communication, networked
    journalism, social networks, and mass media theory. As a scholar centrally interested
    in political activism and political engagement online, she explores how mass media
    effect theories take shape and evolve due to the growth of networked, social media
    technologies that empower political publics. In bringing a social network analytic
    perspective to the evolving media ecology, she has explored such new theoretical
    premises as networked gatekeeping, networked framing, network agenda setting,
    memetics, and virality. Meraz is also interested in automated content analysis,
    natural language processing, and social network visualization of big data. Her
    work has explored political activity and activism networks in such social applications
    as blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and online political forums during electoral cycles,
    disaster times, and social movements. Meraz is an Associate Professor and Director
    of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Department of Communication.
