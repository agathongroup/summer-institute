The purpose of the Summer Institutes is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institutes are for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). Since 2017, our Institutes have provided more than 1,200 young scholars with cutting-edge training in the field and the opportunity to develop more than 120 research collaborations that break down disciplinary barriers. There is no tuition required to attend the Summer Institutes, and some locations cover the cost of travel, accommodation, and meals.
