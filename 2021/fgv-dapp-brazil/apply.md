# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D., and computational social scientists working on NGOs. Because we are interested in building a community of computational social scientists in Brazil, we are particularly interested in applicants from Brazil, or currently working on Brazilian Institutions. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Previous programming skills are important, but it is not mandatory for your application to be considered. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Given the expertise hosted at the FGV-DAPP, we are particularly interested in participants with interests aligned with communication studies, social media analysis, and public policy. 

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: 

-  a curriculum vitae (CV),
-  a cover letter (maximum 3 pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science,
-  one writing sample (no more than 30 pages).

**The materials can be submitted in English or Portuguese.**  Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample (3), but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. 

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by April 2.**  All application materials must be submitted through [google forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc63DNHCr4MVOdfOmKNyIod8SAdHn6CHjx3rkr8dXK8k7Ontg/viewform). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by early may, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.
