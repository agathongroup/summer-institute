From June 14 to June 25, 2021, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology will sponsor the 1st Summer Institute in Computational Social Science Hong Kong. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). This is the first time SICSS coming to Hong Kong!

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. Methodological topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability, sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. Site-specific substantive topics include (but are not limited to) political polarization, collective action, social networks, and diffusion. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers,other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to **graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty**. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 10-15 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program, including active participation in group projects.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2021/hong_kong/apply) are due **April 15**. Inquiries can be sent to **sicss.hongkong@gmail.com**.

Working language is English.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all events will take place online.
