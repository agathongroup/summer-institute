### Characterizing the Nature of Online Political Conversations at Scale

### [Ceren Budak](http://cbudak.com/index.html)

#### Abstract

In this talk, I will summarize two studies on citizen participation in political discussions online. In one, I will focus on the substance of such discussions and show how Twitter users frame immigration discourse. I will report on the issue-generic, issue-specific, and narrative frames we identified using supervised learning techniques and show how users’ ideology and region impact framing, and how a message’s framing influences its audience responses. In the second part of the talk, I will focus on the style of political conversations. Focusing on Reddit this time, I will show how norms of toxicity in political discussions are sustained and reproduced, shaping how citizens engage online.
