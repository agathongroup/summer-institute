### Big Data for Studying Human Migration

### Tuba Bircan

#### Abstract

Traditional statistical data on international migration suffers from the problems (gaps) of inconsistency in definitions, differences in geographical coverage, absence of reasons for migration, timeliness and limitations in demographic characteristics. The global-level migration indicators are relatively under-developed; hence, countries are expected to improve capacity to generate timely, reliable, and comparable data on migration to help guide policy makers in devising evidence-based policies and plans of action to tackle migration aspects of the Social Development Goals. Although there is a novel list of potential data sources that could provide valuable, real-time insights, these remain largely understudied for the time being. To be more specific , the data collected or originated by international institutes and the dissemination of this data faces sensitivity obstacles linked to legal terms, purpose of the data, etc. Likewise, some administrative data collected by national and international organisations (e.g. data on recently arrived migrants, percentage of immigrants who have taken part in integration initiatives, longitudinal studies of integration measures) exists but is not available to many researchers and policy-makers. Finally, new sources of data and Big Data (e.g. mobile phone records, social media data, satellite data, etc.) exist and it could be used to fill some of the gaps of the traditional data. There are commercial and/or privacy issues to solve for having access to that data and substantial research and analysis are required before it can meet policy requirements. Overall improving migration data is a crucial step to improving migration governance since better data is needed in order to bring about sustainable social and economic development and national migrant data strategies are needed to inform good policies. This talk will discuss the existing gaps and shortcomings of the international migration statistics and the potential utilisation of Big Data analytics for bridging these gaps. More specifically, mobile phone data, social media data and earth observation data potentials will be explored with specific examples for developing migration indicators for stock and flows as well as some socio-economic integration. Big Data use for humanitarian aid (related to migration and refugees) and the ethical concerns will also be discussed elaborately.
