## Task 3 - Data Wrangling (Second Week: Monday-Tuesday)

There are two popular libraries to handle data in the R environment. The first one is [data.table package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) and the second one is [dplyr package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). I am not stressing pros/cons of these two packages, but you should read [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly) before learning either one. In my view, you should give both a chance and stick with the one that comes natural to you. I can disclose my preference and why I am using it in “real” big data projects during our zoom meetings!

What should you do in this task?

• Read your Twitter and web datasets.

• Subset your data by using a keyword, a time interval, a user name for the Twitter dataset.

• Order your data alphabetically and by weekday! You can use [lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html) for date-time operations.

• Understand what is a merge operation and merge your datasets based on a textual trait.

### Here are some tutorials to data wrangling with R:
