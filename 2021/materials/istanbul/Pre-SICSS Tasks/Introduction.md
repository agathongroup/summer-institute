# SICSS-Istanbul 2021 Pre-SICSS Tasks

## INTRODUCTION

Pre-SICSS tasks require basic knowledge of R. Therefore, we are assuming that you finished [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp/) which is an online 
training program designed to provide you with beginner level skills in coding. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as 
a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials. After you complete the tutorials, you are ready to learn [SICSS Lecture 
Materials](https://sicss.io/curriculum) which provides state-of-the art training in a range of different areas in computational social science from ethics to text analysis and mass collaboration. You can find videos, slides, code, and teaching exercises. These lectures also assume a basic, working knowledge of the R language.

When it comes to our Pre-SICSS tasks, we provide you with practical experience of Day 2 (Collecting Digital Trace Data) and Day 3(Automated Text Analysis) of 
[SICSS Lecture Materials](https://sicss.io/curriculum). In our Pre-SICSS tasks, we are extending Day 2 and 3 exercises, and providing more time to finish them 
individually (or in a group setting) considering different learning curves in our cohort.  We believe that learning to code is an individual process, but some 
would see a benefit to solve tasks in a group setting. Therefore, we are leaving the decision of doing our tasks individually or in a group setting to you.  

To help you in this process, [Ahmet Kurnaz](https://sicss2021.slack.com/archives/D0248VAJCRE) will organize code walkthrough sessions for each task. Thus, 
participants will have a chance to replicate the codes on 
their desk to improve their coding experience. 

Additionally, you can request an one-to-one office hour from [Emre Tapan](https://sicss2021.slack.com/archives/D01GW4RAZ9B#) when you get stuck and need support. 
We strongly suggest that when you face a bug or 
difficulty, instead of immediately asking it, you should try to solve your problems by searching on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)! 

We are listing some helpful links you would need to look at while solving our tasks: 

- [R Studio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/) is a great place to start to learn R. No one is born a data scientist. Every person who works with R today was once a complete beginner. No matter how much you know about the R ecosystem already, you’ll always have more to learn.
- [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp/) is an online training program designed to provide you with beginner level skills in coding so that you can follow the more advanced curriculum we teach at the partner locations of the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science. The videos and materials are designed for complete beginners and are best viewed as a sequence since each video builds upon content introduced in previous tutorials.
- [SICSS Lecture Materials](https://sicss.io/curriculum) provides state-of-the art training in a range of different areas in computational social science from ethics to text analysis and mass collaboration. You can find videos, slides, code, and teaching exercises. These lectures assume a basic, working knowledge of the R language. 
- [Alternative Curriculum](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/_data/alternative_curriculum.md) is produced by organizers of SICSS partner sites to serve the needs of different audiences. 

## Data Project Steps 

We thought that completing a whole data project before SICSS would make you ready for group work. Therefore, our Pre-SICSS tasks will combine a whole data project. 
Every data project generally has four critical milestones. These are:

• Data collection (using APIs or scraping)

• Data cleaning

• Data analysis

• Reporting 

We created 5 tasks for you. First, you will collect data from the web. You may choose a website or a social media platform as a datasource. Depending on your 
decision, you may want to use APIs or screen scraping methods. In the first week, you will have a handy exercise of both of these methods. In the second week, you 
are expected to clean, manipulate and report the data you obtained from the web. 

  
### NOTICE: All of the recommendations are based on our experience; therefore they can be highly subjective. We do not argue that the packages&approaches we are suggesting in this document are the best ones. However, we are using some of them for a long time, and they have been handy.
