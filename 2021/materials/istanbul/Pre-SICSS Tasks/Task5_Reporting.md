## Task 5 - Reporting Data (Second Week: Friday)

One of the most dominant sides of the R is reporting the data. [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) would provide diverse options from basic scatterplots to drawing complex maps and networks. Once you understand how to build a basic plot with ggplot, it is quite easy to solve any problem and produce classy graphics. You should learn how to use it!
The second essential skill you should learn is working with [markdowns](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). You could effortlessly produce documents like [this one](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html).
Last but not least, if you are fluent with basic R, you could produce great data products with [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). It is not the most straightforward interface library, but you should give it a try once you are ready!

What should you do in this task?

• Load you datasets you created in Task 4.

• Create a new Rmd document in RStudio

• Display your results in a markdown document with explanations. In addition to quanteda’s pretty plots, you could include histograms or even a network of tweeters!

• Display your results in an HTML document
