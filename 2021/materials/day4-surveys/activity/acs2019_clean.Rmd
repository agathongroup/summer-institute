Below is the script used to generate "cleaned_acs19.csv". We use person weights from the 2019 American Community Survey (a 1-in-100 national random sample of the population) to calculate the population of demographic groups in the US. If you would like to run this script yourself (or calculate populations using additional variables and/or different groups), you can get an ACS data extract from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group).
