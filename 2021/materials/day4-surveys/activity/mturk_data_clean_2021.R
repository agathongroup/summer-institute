# Clean mturk responses

# Desired output
# Opinion Questions would have column name as question label, values would be either 1 or 0. 
# For social media usage, 1 means the respondent has used the software; For political priority question, 1 means the issue is seen as "top priority"



# Step 1: Load MTurk survey data

### Before loading data

# - Rename column names 


### Load data and tidy


library(tidyverse)
raw <- read_csv("SICSS Survey 2021.csv")

# - Dropped responses that did not select "I agree" on consent check
# - Dropped duplicates, responses that did not pass attention screening questions
# - Deleted MTurk worker ID, consent check, and timestamp variables

raw <- raw %>% filter(consent == "I agree.")
raw <- raw %>% distinct(id,.keep_all = T)
raw <- raw %>% filter(ac1 == "Barack Obama") %>% filter(ac2 == "Somewhat approve")
raw <- raw %>% select(-ac1,-ac2,-id,-consent,-Timestamp)

# - Rename responses into 1 and 0 for opinion questions
# - Rename responses to match match names in Pew benchmark and cleaned ACS data for demographics questions


# Step 1: rename responses into 1 and 0 values

## Step 2: clean demograhic

# recode race
## note: there are many ways to code these data into mutually exclusive categories
## for simplicity's sake, everyone who checked multiple races is coded as "other",
## and hispanic is added as a separate category that includes everyone who selected yes
## this is just one way to code it and not really the "right" way to deal with this data,
## and you are welcome/encouraged to try other ways

## Step 3: Remove respondents with missingness in demographics
processed <- processed %>% drop_na(region,age_cat,race,sex)

## ACS does not currently allow for an “other” response to sex
## That means that we can’t use the ACS data for post-stratification for these respondents
## You are welcome to find some other way to include these respondents if you would like
## This example helps illustrate how post-stratification depends on having population counts collected by others
processed <- processed %>% filter(sex!="other")



## Step 4: Save cleaned mturk data
write_csv(processed, "2021_clean_mturk_data.csv")
