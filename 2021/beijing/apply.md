# Apply

## Eligibility

There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (1) A short statement (no more than 300 words) that summarizes your research interests, your achievements, and potential contributions to the event; (2) your CV; (3) a publication or writing sample that best represents your research ability and interests; and (4) contact information of a faculty advisor if you are a student or postdoctoral research (we may contact your advisor for further information but no recommendation letter is needed to prepare in advance).

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by April 1 2021.** All application materials must be submitted through [Google form](https://forms.gle/LiAFEw4bPgSYKUxH8).
