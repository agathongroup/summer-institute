<u>Uncovering new keys to countering anti-Black racism and inequity using computational social science</u>
<br><font color="grey"><font size="2">February 4, 2021</font></font> 
<br><i><font size = "2">The depth of knowledge and appreciation for computational social science (a marriage of social science and data science with a bit of computer science) is having a moment right now. Courses and programs seem to be sprouting up all over but the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science hosted by Howard University and sponsored by Mathematica (SICSS-Howard/Mathematica) is the first in the United States with a focus on the seeding and growth of this critical and salient toolkit in underrepresented communities, specifically the Black community.  </font></i>
