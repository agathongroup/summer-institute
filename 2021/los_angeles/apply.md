# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D, with priority given to Ph.D students. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 30 participants will be invited. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) level of interest and/or prior experience in the area of computational social science 2) likelihood to benefit from the topics covered in the curriculum 3) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants and interest in collaboration on a research project 4) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others and 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
