From Monday, June 14 to Friday, June 18, 2021, the Russel Sage foundation and ETH Zürich will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held virtually at ETH Zürich. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists and data scientists (both broadly conceived).

The program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects mentored by SICSS staff. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, web scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. We are committed to open and reproducible research. All materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will thus be released open source.

Participation is primarily geared towards advanced Master's students, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral researchers with an economics or political economy focus.
We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2021/ethzurich/apply) are due Monday, February 22, 2021.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all events will take place online.
