# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to registered Masters and Doctoral students. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. Approximately 15 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities. While we accept all applications, the SICSS-Stellenbosch site aims to offer a more foundational experience in computational social science than other partner sites. As such, applicants who are most likely to benefit from the course material we offer will be given priority in our selection. Applicants with prior experience in computational social science or R are encouraged to apply to other locations.

## How To Apply
