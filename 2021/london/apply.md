## Eligibility

While our primary mission is to build community and support research within London and the UK, participation is open to all early career researchers.  About 20 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. 

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by Friday, March 19, 2021.** All application materials must be submitted through the following google form: [https://forms.gle/HmVx9GFxWEUFyQ29A](https://forms.gle/HmVx9GFxWEUFyQ29A) .  Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants through e-mail by Monday, March 29, 2021, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.
