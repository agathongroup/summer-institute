The 2020 SICSS Festival took place from Monday, June 22 - Friday, June 26, 2020. During the festival, alumni from all SICSS locations hosted a variety of events such as tutorials, panel discussions, or debates.  These events were all held online due to COVID-19.  SICSS Festival events were open to current SICSS participants (at any location) or anyone that is interested; the choice of audience was driven by the topic, learning objectives, and preferences of presenters.  If you are a SICSS alumni and would like to host an event for a future festival, please send SICSS leadership a rough sketch of your idea.

# Monday <a name="monday"></a>

## Panel discussion on teaching computational social science

__Time:__ Monday, June 22, 2020. 12-1pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Matti Nelimarkka](https://matti.mante.li/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Helsinki 18, SICSS-Istanbul 19, 20), [Rochelle Terman](http://rochelleterman.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17), and [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/) (SICSS-Princeton 19, SICSS-Bay Area 20)

__Moderator:__ [Matthew Salganik](https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, 19, SICSS-Duke 18, 20)

__Description:__ Teaching computational social science at both the undergraduate and graduate level presents a number of challenging pedagogical questions. How should we teach a class with students from different disciplinary backgrounds?  What is the role of programming in computational social science education? How should computational social science courses fit into a larger curriculum?  The panelists will address these questions---and others---first in a moderated conversation and then will take questions from the audience.

## Measuring cultural change in digital trace data using diversification rates

__Time:__ Tuesday, June 23, 2020. 1-2 EDT.

__Speaker:__ [Bernard Koch](https://soc.ucla.edu/grads/bernard-koch) (SICSS-Los Angeles 19, 20)

__Description:__ How do we measure cultural change? Through the birth and death of “cultural lineages” (e.g., hashtags, consumer goods, or musical artists), digital trace data allows us to observe cultural change at population scale over time. This tutorial introduces a statistical framework to identify and explain culturally important historical events through changes in the diversity of cultural lineages over time. Users will learn how to run an unsupervised machine learning model called ___LiteRate___ to identify statistically significant shifts in cultural diversity, as well as more restricted models to test theoretical hypotheses about the causes of these events. The tutorial will be accessible to a broad audience.

## Discussion on diversity in computational social science

__Time:__ Tuesday, June 23, 2020. 3:30-4:30pm EDT

__Speaker:__ [Naniette H. Coleman](https://www.naniettecoleman.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 19)

__Host:__ [Matthew Salganik](https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, 19, SICSS-Duke 18, 20)

__Description:__ In order to thrive, the field of computational social science needs contributions from diverse scholars. This discussion will address this broad challenge in a specific setting: the creation of SICSS-Howard/Mathematica (links to [website](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/howard-mathematica/), form to join the [email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfD7YNUdhhngu4glivO2CAzKX1ief6p2Yyj2B49cdwgk-qwCA/viewform?usp=sf_link), and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SICSS.Howard.Mathematica)), the first SICSS located at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU). Although this site has been postponed until 2021 due to COVID-19, it still serves as a useful case study for discussion. The discussion will focus on efforts to increase diversity in computational social science, why this work is important, and what should be done in the future. There will also be time for the audience to submit written questions to be asked by the host.

## Computational social science to address the (post) COVID-19 reality

__Time:__ Wednesday, June 24, 2020, 10–11:15am EDT

__Speakers:__ [Johan Bollen](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/jbollen/) and [Dean Eckles](https://www.deaneckles.com/)

__Moderators:__ [Maria Ferreira Sequeda](https://think.ing.com/author/maria-ferreira-sequeda/) and [Monika Leszczynska](https://empiricalcontracts.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 19, SICSS-Maastricht 20)

__Description:__ Computational Social Science offers tools that can assist both policy makers and the private sector in the design and implementation of measures to address the economic and social challenges posed by COVID-19. How can the growing sources of (alternative) data and data science be used in a meaningful and responsible way, i.e. providing reliable and practical knowledge without compromising privacy and safety of people whose data is collected and analyzed? What are the methodological and regulatory solutions that could be applied to address the challenges and mitigate the risks? Our panelists will share their experience and ideas on these issues. There will also be enough time for questions from the audience.

Co-organized with the [Maastricht Law and Tech Lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab), [ING](https://www.ing.com/), and the [Think Forward Initiative](https://www.thinkforwardinitiative.com/)

## Panel discussion on digital and computational demography

__Time:__ Wednesday, June 24, 2020. 11:30am-12:30pm EDT

__Speakers:__ [Nicolò Cavalli](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/graduate/nicolo-cavalli.html) (SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Oxford 19), [Ridhi Kashyap](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/ridhi-kashyap/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Oxford 19),  and [Francesco Rampazzo](https://francescorampazzo.com/) (SICSS-Duke 18)

__Moderator:__ [Vissého Adjiwanou](https://sociologie.uqam.ca/corps-professoral/professeurs-es/professeur/adjiwanou.visseho/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Cape Town 18, 19, SICSS-Montreal 20)

__Description:__ The panel will begin with a broad introduction to digital and computational approaches to demography.  Next, panelists will present examples drawing on some of their own work  of digital and computational approaches to demographic research in two areas: 1) migration and 2) digital inequality and its implications for demographic processes.  Following these specific examples, the panel will reflect on future directions for digital demography, both in the context of the promises and perils of this emerging area in demographic research, as well as in relation to its role within the broader computational social science community.  We aim for this conversation to include a wider discussion between panelists and participants, and encourage broad participation from those within computational social science, demography and population studies communities.

## What Can the SICSS Community Do to Recognize and Eradicate Anti-Black Racism in Computational Social Science?

__Time:__ Thursday, June 25. 2-3 PM EDT

__Organizers:__ [Tina Law](https://tinalaw1.github.io/) (SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Chicago 19) and [Taylor W. Brown](https://www.taylorwhittenbrown.com/) (SICSS-Princeton 17, SICSS-Duke 18, SICSS-Oxford 19) 

__Description:__ Right now, protests are taking place around the world in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, and countless other Black lives, and many necessary conversations are being had about anti-Black racism. As members of the SICSS community, what can we do to recognize and eradicate anti-Black racism in our own field? Computational social science is a relatively new field with a lot of potential for positive social change. It is also a field born out of two long-standing disciplines--computer science and social science--that have histories of marginalizing Black scholarship and contributing to anti-Black policies and programs. What are the opportunities and challenges that we face as computational social scientists when it comes to addressing anti-Black racism? And, how can the SICSS community leverage our unique strength as a global network of teachers and scholars to combat anti-Black racism? This discussion and planning session is open to SICSS participants and alumni who are interested in actively tackling these questions together.

__Open to:__ SICSS participants and alumni. Unlimited number of registered participants. Registration has closed.

__Format:__ Discussion & planning session; note that this is not a panel, active participation is encouraged.
