## Howard University
Established in 1867, Howard University is a federally chartered, private, doctoral degree granting Historically Black 
University. With an enrollment of over 9,000 students (3,000 of which are graduate students), it’s undergraduate, 
graduate, professional, and joint degree programs span more than 120 areas of study within 13 schools and colleges. 
The historic main campus sits on two hundred and fifty-six acres on a hilltop in Northwest Washington blocks from the 
storied U Street and Howard Theatre and   two miles from the U.S. Capitol. Howard University’s founding of 
SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI with Mathematica is yet another way that 
Howard continues its commitment to the context of our founding – an unwavering question to balance the scales for the 
disenfranchised, and promote an American that is devoid of inequalities.  Howard has existed to address a plethora of 
disparities that disproportionately affect the African-American population wherever it may occur.  AI presents a rapidly 
evolving frontier where new voices are needed more than ever to promote Veritas and Utilitias (Truth and Service).  

### Mathematica
Founded in 1968, Mathematica reimagines the way the world gathers and uses data, surfacing evidence and insights that 
illuminate the path to progress for public- and private-sector changemakers. Driven by our mission to improve public 
well-being and our steadfast commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion, Mathematica’s nearly 1400 employees 
collaborate closely with public- and private-sector partners to inform program and policy decisions in health, human services, 
and international development. Throughout SICSS-Howard/Mathematica: Lifting New Voices to Address Ethics and Equity in AI, our 
data and public policy experts will work alongside participants to help translate big questions into deep insights that 
improve programs, refine strategies, and enhance equity.
