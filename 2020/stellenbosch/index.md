From 15 to 26 June 2020, the Department of Information Science at Stellenbosch University will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Masters and Doctoral students and junior academic staff who have not yet completed a PhD. Costs of the workshop, including most meals, will be covered. Additionally, there is limited funding available for accomodation and travel for some participants who are not based in the greater Cape Town area. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Approximately 15 to 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

Application materials are due by 20 March 2020.
