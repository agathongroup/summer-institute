From the morning of June 15 to 26, 2020, Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ) will host a partner site for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be guest speakers from institutions and organizations in the regional area who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, machine learning, network analysis, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. 

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty. Most participant costs during the workshop, including lunch, will be covered, but participants will need to arrange for their own travel to and/or housing in New Brunswick, NJ. We may be able to provide some funding to help offset commuting costs.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science and those whose research focuses on social progress (broadly conceived), particularly research on race, gender, sexuality, and social or economic inequality. About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. 

Preference will be given to participants from Rutgers and nearby institutions with a goal being to build a regional community of researchers interested in computational social science, but all applications will be given consideration.

The Rutgers partner event is supported by the Rutgers University library, the Rutgers Department of Political Science, and the primary Summer Institute in Computational Social Science program. 

Application materials are due March 30, 2020. Inquiries may be sent to sicssrutgers@gmail.com.
