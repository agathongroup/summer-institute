From the evening of Sunday, July 19 to Friday, July 31, 2020, the University of Konstanz will host a partner event for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The purpose of SICSS Konstanz is to bring together interested Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral students and faculty in Germany. The Summer Institute will be for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures and group problem sets in the first week and participant-led research projects in the second week. Participants are able to work in teams to learn how to implement the material from the lectures. Covered topics include ethics, web scraping and collecting digital trace data, automated text analysis, digital field experiments, and surveys in the digital age. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

We are inviting applications from Master students, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 5 years of their PhD. Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less coding experience will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. There is no cost for participating in the Summer Institute. For a limited number of participants, we will be able to cover housing and meal expenses up to a set cap.
