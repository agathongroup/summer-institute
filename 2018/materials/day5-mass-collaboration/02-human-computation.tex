Here's a piece of the manifesto of the Labor Party in the United Kingdom from 2010:

\begin{quote}
``Millions of people working in our public services embody the best values of Britain, helping empower people to make the most of their own lives while protecting them from the risks they should not have to bear on their own. Just as we need to be bolder about the role of government in making markets work fairly, we also need to be bold reformers of government.''
\end{quote}
