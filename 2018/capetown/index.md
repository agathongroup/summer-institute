From the morning of June 18 to the afternoon of June 29, a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science will to be held at the University of Cape Town. The purpose of the Summer Institute in Cape Town is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). 

The organizer and principal faculty of the Summer Institute in Cape Town is Visseho Adjiwanou. It is supported by the University of Cape Town. The Cape Town satellite, around with the other five satellites in US and Helsinki are organized with the support of the Summer Institute organised at Duke https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/. 

The instructional program will involve lectures (mostly livestream from Duke University), group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Master and Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from universities in South Africa. Meals and registrations fees are covered. Participants from outside South Africa are welcomed if only they are able to cover their participation costs (tickets and accomodation). About twenty participants will be invited. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/capetown/apply) should be received by Monday, April 23, 2018.
