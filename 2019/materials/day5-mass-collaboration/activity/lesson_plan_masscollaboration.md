# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2019
## Day 5, Mass collaboration
## Prepared by Matt Salganik and Alex Kindel

### Summary

In this activity, participants will take part in a simulated Fragile Families Challenge.  They will use the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data collected from a child's birth to age 9 in order to predict 6 outcomes at child age 15: 1) child grade point average (GPA), 2) child grit, 3) household eviction, 4) household material hardship, 5) caregiver layoff, and 6) caregiver participation in job training.

### Learning objectives

- Practice data wrangling for predictive modeling
- Practice using machine learning methods for predictive modeling
- Experience using the common task method

### Instruction preparation

To prepare for this activity you should:
- Get the data files, which will require you to sign a data use agreement; contact Alex Kindel for data access
- Prepare a way to responsibly share the data with the participants at your site
- Read the slides that I will use to introduce the activity
- Optional: Learn more about the [Fragile Families Challenge](http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/)
- Optional: Watch videos from the [Fragile Families Challenge Scientific Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjluzrRT8fqXCx3qHjQAb5A)
- Optional: Provide participants with access to the baseline submission (submission.zip).
- REMEMBER THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS SHOULD DELETE THEIR DATA WHEN THE ACTIVITY IS OVER. If they would like access to the data for future research, they can contact Kate Jaeger: kjaeger at princeton dot edu.

### Group formation

Form groups of 3-5 people randomly. If possible, each group should have at least one person with experience doing applied predictive modeling. It would also be good to ensure that the people most skilled in programming are spread between groups.

### Rough schedule

- Introduction (1 hour; livestreamed)
- Getting started (1 hour; not livestreamed)
- Lunch (1 hour)
- Work on Fragile Families Challenge in groups (2 hours; not livestreamed)
- Discussion (20 minutes; not livestreamed)

### Notes

- Participants should not expect to prepare the data and try many different sophisticated models in the time available. A good approach would be to focus on just one outcome of interest and try models of increasing complexity after successfully submitting a basic linear model to the leaderboard.

- Participants can upload their predictions to the leaderboard on CodaLab: https://codalab.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/competitions/26

- This activity requires a lot of data wrangling and R fluency.

- Here are some tips about [data preparation](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2019/materials/day5-mass-collaboration/activity/SICSS_FFC_datacleaning_tips.pdf).

- Here's a [basic submission file](https://github.com/compsocialscience/summer-institute/blob/master/2019/materials/day5-mass-collaboration/activity/submission.zip) that includes predictions, narrative explanation, and code
