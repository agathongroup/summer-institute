EMR: What is it?
========================================================

- Digital version of a patient's medical chart. 
- Contains information across time and space about healthcare visits, diagnoses, procedures, imaging, demographics, psychosocial and behavioral characteristics.

EMR: What's in it?
========================================================

EMR as big data 
- 3Vs: high volume, variety, and velocity 
- Different data collected from each clinical setting (outpatient vs ER vs inpatient)

EMR: What's in it?
========================================================

- Biomedical health information
- Demographics: age, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, language, education 
- Geographic: home address, healthcare locations
- Sociobehavioral: smoking, alcohol and drug use, marriage status, employment, religious beliefs, firearms, violence in home, lead exposure

EMR: What's in it?
========================================================

- Every time a provider (physician, nurse, social worker) interacts with a patient, they write a clincial note 
- Large corpus of unstructured text data


EMR: How is it generated? 
========================================================

- EMR format is customized by each healthcare system and is frequently updated
- Highly unstandardized across time and space

EMR: How is it generated? 
========================================================

- Clinical documents to describe patient's medical history to other providers
- But also insurance/billing and legal documents 

EMR: How is it generated?

EMR: How do I get it? 
========================================================

- Pass hospital IRB 
- HIPAA privacy restrictions 
- Coordinate with institutional data store 

EMR: How do I get it? 
========================================================

- Open source options: 
- Synthea: <https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/>
- MIMIC-III <https://mimic.physionet.org/>


Future directions? 
========================================================

- Merging personal device data
- Social media data
- Predictive analytics
