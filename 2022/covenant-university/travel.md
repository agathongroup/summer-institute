## Travel 

SICSS-Covenant will cover the cost of a return economy-class flight to and from Covenant University for international participants. Due to funding limitations, we can only provide travel assistance up to a fixed cap for participants coming from outside Nigeria. We are not able to reimburse participants for local transportation costs, including transport from participants’ homes to the airport, COVID-19 test costs or others. Accepted participants are encouraged to search for additional funding to cover other travel-associated costs.

## Accommodation & Meals

All accepted participants will be accommodated at one of the Postgraduate halls of residence at Covenant University. Meals (up to a set cap) for all participants will also be served during the institute.


## COVID-19 Safety Protocols

All participants should be vaccinated against COVID-19. Participants will be required to wear nose masks during the institute. Additionally, all measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19 are fully adhered to during the institute.

Inquiries can be sent to cepder@covenantuniversity.edu.ng
