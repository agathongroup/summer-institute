# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to graduate students (master and doctoral programs). However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship or country of study. Applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study are welcome, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 40 participants will be invited.


The Summer Institute aims to bring together graduate students interested in computational social science across all levels of technical experience. Courses will be mostly taught in Python. Participants are expected to be familiar with Python, however, those with little experience with coding in Python would be invitated to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.


## How To Apply


Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement of interest (maximum two pages) describing your interest in computational social science, and explaining why you would benefit from the Summer Institute. All application materials must be submitted through the following [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8ETUTqRI3pelfsTWTnpL8FiKafFUvOkfhl8WJCJxEvgjgjw/viewform)


**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by April 30, 2022 at 11:59pm [Anywhere on Earth](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe)** We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by Mai 31, 2022 and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Aachen-Graz, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Aachen-Graz if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
