From July 18 to July 30, 2022, [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/research/computation-social-science-lab-css-lab/) and [RWTH Aachen](http://cssh.rwth-aachen.de/) will organize the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held virtually. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate student interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and computer scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, and machine learning. We will also discuss methodological and ethical limitation of computational approaches to social science questions.  There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to 40. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 40 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/aachen-graz/apply) are due April 30, 2022.
