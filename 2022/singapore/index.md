From June 13 to June 24, 2022, the [Centre for Trusted Internet & Community](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) and the [Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at [the National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty members interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who are internationally recognised and who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students (including masters students, preferably those with a prominent research component in their degree), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D.. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/singapore/apply) are due Monday, February 21, 2022.

Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are currently planning the summer school to be hybrid in nature, with participants from Singapore being required to attend all events physically, while those outside Singapore joining virtually. This arrangement is tentative and may change depending on the evolving nature of the situation, and in response to restrictions that may be in place at the time of the event.
