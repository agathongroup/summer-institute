## Program

The six-week program consists of two parts as follows. 

**(1) June 20 to July 17, 2022:** The Program starts with a 4-week self-paced, fully remote learning bootcamp. During the bootcamp, our participants will learn the basics of the programming language R and the fundamentals of computational social science through various online videos and other reading materials. Our participants should expect to spend 5-10 hours per week studying during the bootcamp.  We will host office hours for our participants to ask questions.

**(2) July 18 to July 30, 2022:** Following the bootcamp is a 2-week hybrid program of live online and in-person sessions. The last three days of the hybrid program (July 28, 29 and 30) will be hosted in person at National Chengchi University. During the hybrid program, our participants will meet daily from 9am to 4pm and engage in lectures, group problem sets, code-along tutorials, collaborative discussion activities, lightning talks, and participant-led projects. We expect to cover topics like text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. The second week of the hybrid program will be dedicated to a group project. Each group will consist of 3-5 participants and expect to develop research or tutorial projects related to computational social science.
