From July 18 to July 30, 2022, the Russel Sage Foundation and the International College of Innovation (ICI) of National Chengchi University will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at National Chengchi University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Our target audience is data scientists and social scientists who are in academia or industry in Taiwan. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants new to computational social science. About 24 participants will be invited to our two-week program (8 days online, 3 days in-person). In addition to the two week synchronous program, SICSS-Taiwan will have one month of asynchronous and guided online learning, called bootcamp, to help build foundation in social science researh and data science skills from June 13 to July 17 2022.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/taiwan/apply) will be announced at the end of January, 2022. 

We are hosting monthly 30 min info sessions online from December to March. You can [subscribe to our email updates](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_rtXqZHelZ1RlJYJi4oBB95gL0kza0vWlyNcqF5UnXg7gUw/viewform?usp=sf_link) regarding the upcoming SICSS-Taiwan information.
