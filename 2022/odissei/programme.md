The SICSS-ODISSEI will show participants all the possibilities that ODISSEI has to offer in terms of facilities, tools and research support. SICSS-ODISSEI will not only focus on teaching participants relevant methodologies, theories and techniques for computational social science, but also allow participants to apply this knowledge on ODISSEI services, including executing specific projects using microdata via the CBS Secure Remote Access Environment and an introduction to the [ODISSEI Secure Supercomputer](https://odissei-data.nl/en/using-the-odissei-secure-supercomputer-ossc/).

Participants will be able to develop research ideas with other computational social scientists and turn these into exciting new projects that can be executed within ODISSEI. Participants will be supported by experts in the field and projects could be developed into further long-term research, a grant application or scientific publication. At the end of the two weeks, participants will be able to present their research as a poster at the [European Consortium of Sociological Research Conference](https://ecsr2022.eu/) which will be held in Amsterdam on 7-9 July.

Participants will get an introduction to working with CBS ([Statistics Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb)) data, where theyâ€™ll be able to see the full potential of administrative data, high performance computing and intensively linked data. Participants will also be guided on how to develop their ideas into large projects and learn how ODISSEI infrastructure can be adapted to their own needs. During the SICSS-ODISSEI programme, participants will get lectures from colleagues at ODISSEI member organisations on topics such as Network Analysis, Machine Learning, Geospatial Analysis and Benchmarking and apply these in hands-on workshops. During the SICSS-ODISSEI programme, participants will get lectures from colleagues at ODISSEI member organisations, such as [SoDa](https://odissei-data.nl/en/using-soda/), [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb), [Centerdata](https://www.centerdata.nl/en/), [Netherlands Twin Register](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research/institutes/amsterdam-public-health/strengths/aph-cohorts/-netherlands-twin-register-1.htm).

Participants will need to develop their knowledge and skills in a relatively short period, so in preparation for the summer school participants are able to follow a workshop in data carpentry, organised by the Netherlands eScience Center, to enhance their skills prior to SICSS-ODISSEI.

More general topics that the summer school will cover include for example network techniques, natural and mass online experiments, geospatial analysis, benchmarking, and machine learning.

More information about the schedule and collaborations will be announced soon.
