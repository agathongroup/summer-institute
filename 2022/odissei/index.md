From June 20 to July 1, 2022, ODISSEI will host a Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the Netherlands. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career researchers interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

[ODISSEI](https://odissei-data.nl/en/) is the Dutch national infrastructure for social science. Providing analytical tools and software, secure supercomputing power and expertise, ODISSEI is building an overarching and interlinked infrastructure to guide researchers through the rich datasets that are available in the Netherlands. SICSS-ODISSEI participants will be able to share their research, discuss their ideas and connect with other researchers in related fields, across the world. ODISSEI will provide participants with unique access to its infrastructure during the summer school including administrative data at CBS, time on the national supercomputer, the support of Research Software Engineers (RSE) at eScience and time in the nationally representative LISS Panel. Participants will also be supported with grants after the summer school to help them apply their new found skills in collaborative projects.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and interactive work sessions. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are required to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/odissei/apply) are due February 28.
