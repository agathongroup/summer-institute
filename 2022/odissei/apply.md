# Apply

## Eligibility

Our primary target audience is postdoctoral researchers, PhD students and advanced Masters’ students. The targeted fields of research are principally sociology, psychology, economics and political science. However,  individuals or junior researchers actively involved or interested in related fields may apply for the programme. 

About 20 participants will be invited. The Summer School is open to participants from outside of the Netherlands. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment.

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 
- research and teaching in the area of computational social science 
- contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 
- likelihood to benefit from participation 
- likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 
- potential to spread computational social science throughout the ODISSEI community.
 
Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicant’s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-ODISSEI, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-ODISSEI if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
