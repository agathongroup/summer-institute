**Overview**

From June 19 to June 29, 2022, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and KDI School of Public Policy and Management will co-host a partner location for the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science. The event will be held at the KAIST (SICSS-Korea). The institute is the first SICSS partner location in South Korea.

SICSS-Korea has been generously supported by both KAIST ([School of Humanities and Social Sciences](https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/), [Center for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences](http://dhcss.kaist.ac.kr/), and [Graduate School of Culture Technology](https://ct.kaist.ac.kr/main.php?lang=2)) and KDI School ([Applied Data Science Lab](https://research.kdischool.ac.kr:8446/lab/ADSL)). SICSS-Korea is co-organized by [Lanu Kim](https://lanukim.github.io/), [Wonjae Lee](https://sociology.kaist.ac.kr/), and [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/). The Summer Institute aims to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

Our instructional program involves lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in various settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. Students will have ample opportunities to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to graduate students (including master and PhD students), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. If you are an undergraduate student with substantial research experience, you are encouraged to apply. We also receive applications from incoming PhD students.  We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially those currently under-represented groups in computational social science. About fifteen participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program held at KAIST.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/korea/apply) are due March 31, 2022 (KST).
