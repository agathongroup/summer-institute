# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 15 participants will be invited. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be supported by teaching assistants during the Summer Institute.

We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

We also ask applicants to upload the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae (in English), (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science (in English/Korean), and (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages; in English/Korean). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample, but if you submit co-authored work, we recommend that you include a few sentences describing the contributions of each individual author. Optionally, if you don't have a good writing sample yet, you can submit a well-documented research project website (e.g., GitHub repositories with a README file explaining the file structure, the project goal, procedures, and key outcomes).

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 31, 2022 (KST). The invitation emails will be sent by April 30, 2022 (KST).** All application materials must be submitted through \_\_\_\_\_. Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by sicss.korea@gmail.com, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to sicss.korea@gmail.com.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Korea, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Korea if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
