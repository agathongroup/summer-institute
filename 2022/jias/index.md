From 20 June to 8 July, 2022, The Johannesburg Institute for Advanced Study (JIAS) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at JIAS in hybrid format. The first two weeks will be carried online. The second week will be in-person at JIAS, Johannesburg, South Africa*. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional programme will involve lectures, group problem sets and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and research with the organisers, other participants and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to registered Masters, Doctoral Students and Postdoctoral researchers. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Approximately 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire three-week program.

Application materials are due 11:59pm SAST on Thursday, 31 March 2022.

*Due to the uncertainties brought on by the pandemic the structure of events are subject to change. We hope to follow a hybrid structure. Online participation is not restricted while In-person participation will be limited as day-participation to participants who are able to travel to JIAS.
