From 20 June to 8 July, 2022, [The Johannesburg Institute for Advanced Study (JIAS)](https://jias.joburg/) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at JIAS in a hybrid format*. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers interested in critical computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

JIAS is an institute based at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Although only launched in May 2015 as the first fully-fledged institute for advanced learning in Gauteng, South Africa's economic and political heartland, JIAS has grown to be one of the leading institutes of its kind based in the African continent. JIAS aims to create the conditions in which participants can deliver cutting edge interdisciplinary thought and research at the highest academic level. This is done by reaching beyond the regular teaching and research routines of contemporary higher education, and by encouraging collaborative scholarly cooperation in both the social and natural sciences. SICSS-JIAS participants have the opportunity to form part of the JIAS community beyond the summer institute. Participants may be supported with grants to assist in collaborative research projects. 

The SICSS-JIAS instructional programme will involve lectures, group problem sets and participant-led research projects. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning and ethics. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings and contexts. Speakers will touch on topics such as artificial intelligence in Africa, equity, ethics, decolonisation and algorithmic justice. There will be ample opportunities for participants to discuss their ideas and research with the organisers, other participants and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to registered masters and doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers and researchers working outside of academia. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Approximately 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire three-week programme.

Application materials are due 11:59pm SAST (GMT+2) on Thursday, 31 March 2022.

*Due to the uncertainties brought on by the pandemic the structure of events is subject to change. We hope to follow a hybrid format. The first two weeks will take place online. The third week will combine remote and in-person participation. Online participation is not restricted while in-person will be limited to participants who are able to travel to JIAS. In-person participants will be provided with meals daily. We hope to provide accommodation for participants outside of Johannesburg but within South Africa.
