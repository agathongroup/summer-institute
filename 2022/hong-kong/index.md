From June 20 to July 1, 2022, the second Summer Institute in Computational Social Science at Hong Kong will be hosted and sponsored by the [Computational Social Science Laboratory (CSSL)](http://cssl.socsc.cuhk.edu.hk/) and the [Centre for Population Research of the Department of Sociology](http://www.soc.cuhk.edu.hk/research/cpr/cpr-about-us/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Methodological topics covered include text as data, web scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. Site-specific substantive topics include (but are not limited to) political polarization, misinformation, collective action, social networks, and diffusion. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source. **Please note that the focus of the program is more on bringing young scholars together and developing collaborative research projects using tools and methods in computational social science than on teaching programming techniques**.

Participation is restricted to **graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty**. Advanced undergraduate students will also be considered. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. The SICSS at Hong Kong will be organized on a small-group basis to ensure the quality of learning and networking. Prior experience with computational methods is a plus but not required. The eventâ€™s working language is English, therefore proficiency in English will be needed. Participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/hong-kong/apply) are due **April 15**. Inquiries can be sent to **sicss.hongkong@gmail.com**
