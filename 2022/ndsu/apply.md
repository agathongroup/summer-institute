# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is open to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, early career faculty members, and industiral practitioners. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. 

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete the SICSS coding boot camp. Participants doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science; 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others; 3) likelihood to benefit from participation; 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants; 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement of interest, describing your current research using computational social science and/or interest in computational social science for your future research (500 words maximum).

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by April 10, 2022 through [this online form](https://ndstate.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_23iy2yXc4Z6guCW).** Applications that are not completed by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants through e-mail by April 20 2022, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to sicss.ndsu@gmail.com.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-NDSU, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an application under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-NDSU if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
