From July 3 to July 15, 2022, [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/) (in conjunction with the [Said Business School](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](https://www.demographicscience.ox.ac.uk/)) will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Oxford University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

During the first week we will follow a largely instructional program which will involve taught workshops (and group exercises) in the morning, reflections and discussion groups based on the material provided by the other (main and partner) SICCS sites over lunch and in the early afternoon, followed by research talks and introductions to specific areas of computational social science from Oxford and beyond. This will also include speakers from industry, government and those who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, not limited to academia.

The second week will focus solely on group based participant-led research projects, with funding available to build the foundations of teams and ideas which can produce publishable work, with input from the conveners. 

While the list is subject to change, we intend to hold instructional workshops on topics such as:

1. Reproducible research and ethics;
2. Web scraping and text as data;
3. Non-random probability sampling and post-stratification;
4. Social networks and simulations;
5. Machine learning;
6. Geospatial analysis and visualisation.

Participation is restricted to postgraduate research, doctoral and early career researchers (within 7 years of PhD completion). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 25 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend, participate and engage in the entire program.
