<u>Female scientists don’t get the credit they deserve. A study proves it.</u>
<br><font color="grey"><font size="2">Jun 22, 2022</font></font> 
<br><i><font size = "2">Female scientists are “significantly less likely” than men to be credited as authors. SICSS-H/M Lunchtime speaker Professor Christen Smith, founder of Cite Black Women, discussed how women, and especially women of color, are under-cited and even excluded from authorship in this article.</font></i>

<br><u>Inside an Initiative to Diversify the Field of Computational Social Science</u>
<br><font color="grey"><font size="2">Oct 13, 2021</font></font> 
<br><i><font size = "2">This episode of On the Evidence focuses on a creative initiative designed to build a more diverse pipeline of researchers who use methods and tools from data science and social science. Earlier this year, Howard University and Mathematica sponsored a free, two-week training for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty in the fields of data science and social science. The training was part of a broader instructional program held at 20 sites across the globe called the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS). The Howard-Mathematica SICSS was unique in that it was the first site to be hosted by a historically Black college or university (Howard) and the first to focus on anti-Black racism and inequity.</font></i>
