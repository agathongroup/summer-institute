# SICSS Group Exercise Week 2, Day 1

## Introduction to Computational Social Science Ethics

- Read through this [case study](https://bdes.datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Patreon-Case-Study.pdf) of researchers facing a decision about research ethics.

- Consider these five questions and how they relate to this case study and make note of your thoughts and responses. When thinking about these questions, try use the topics covered in Matt's videos as a starting point (respect for persons, beneficence, justice for law, and public interest). In the evening debrief we will work through your thoughts and opinions on these questions so it is worth making notes as you read the case and the questions.

  - Question 1) Does the illegal nature of the data collection and the release of private data taint the data in the release that was already publicly available?
    - Follow up questions:
      - What if the data breach was accidental rather than a hack?
      - What if the data hack was intentionally done by a competitor to Patreon with the goal of putting them out of business?
      - What if the data release was intentional by Patreon even if it violates users' expectations? For example, the release of the AOL search log data: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html (see also: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/technology/23search.html)
      - What kind of precedent would this set? Would other researchers then hack data and release it anonymously?
      - How can you ensure the accuracy of the data?

  - Question 2) Users of Patreon initially had an expectation of privacy, but that privacy no longer exists. Do researchers need to respect the intent or the reality?
      - Follow up questions:
        - What if these were electronic medical records? Would that be different?

  - Question 3) Scholars and journalists share some functions in dealing with information and making it accessible to the public, but are the ethical considerations the same? If not, why not?
    - Follow up questions:
      - Journalists are often supervised by editors. Would it make the project more ethically permissible if these researchers had some third-party ethical review from an organisation like an IRB?
      - Journalists doing investigative reporting often work to expose wrong-doing. Some academic research is like that and some is not. Does it matter about the specific nature of the research?

  - Question 4) Researchers will nearly always claim that their research will have a net public benefit and thus their methods are justified. Who gets to decide if that is accurate in any given case?
    - Follow up questions:
      - If they used the data and you were reviewing the paper for a journal, would you accept it?
      - If you were going to use the data, how would you describe it in an ethical appendix?
      - Here's a case where researchers used diplomatic cables that were released by Private Manning to WikiLeaks: https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpv005. How are these cases similar or different? What do you think about the decision of these researchers?

  - Question 5) Would you personally use the hacked data in this situation?
