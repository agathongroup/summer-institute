# Apply

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by 4th April 2022.** through [this form](https://forms.gle/pFpN7H7ny2n5h6yEA).**


## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to undergraduate students, master students, doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, young industry professionals and early career faculty (within 7 years of PhD) from both industry and academia. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 25 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: 
(a) CV
(b) A statement on ongoing research projects (around 300 words)
(c) A list of relevant completed coursework

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by 4th April 2022.** through [this form](https://forms.gle/pFpN7H7ny2n5h6yEA).** Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Delhi, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Delhi if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.

#### Do I need to be familiar with any programming language?

Yes. If your application gets accepted, then we would expect that at the time of the event, you have some basic knowledge of programming in Python. 

#### Is the summer institute for social scientists or data scientists?

Both. As the programme focuses on computational social science, which is an intersection of social science and computer science, therefore all the lectures and tutorials will focus on both the aspects.

#### Is there any fees to participate in SICSS-Delhi?

No. There is no fees for participation in SICSS-Delhi. Moreover it is being conducted virtually, therefore there will not be any transportation/food/accomodation expenses involved in otherwise phyiscal event. 


#### Is there any preference to the candidates based on their qualification

No. We aim to include a diverse set of participants, ranging from undergraduate students to young industry professionals.
