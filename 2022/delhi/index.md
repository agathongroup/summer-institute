From Monday, June 13  to Friday, June 17, 2022, SICSS Core along with Centre for Social and Behaviour Change (CSBC), Ashoka University will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be co-hosted by Ashoka University and CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation. Due to uncertainities surrounding COVID-19 pandemic, SICSS Delhi will be held in a virtual mode. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to master students, doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers
and early career faculty(within 7 years of PhD) from both industry and academia. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About \_\_\_\_\_ participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire week-long program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/delhi/apply) are due May 1, 2022.
