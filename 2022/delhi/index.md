From Monday, June 13  to Friday, June 17, 2022, SICSS Core will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be co-hosted by Centre for Social and Behaviour Change (CSBC), Ashoka University and CSIR-Central Scientific Instruments Organisation. Due to uncertainities surrounding COVID-19 pandemic, SICSS Delhi will be held in a virtual mode. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). *There is no cost to participate in SICSS-Delhi.*

The instructional program will involve lectures and hands-on tutorials by faculties. There will also be invited speakers from reputated national as well as international organsations who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Some of the topics to be covered includes digital data, natural language processing, machine learning, crowdsourcing and ethics. The overall theme of the program will be both computational as well as experimental research. Moreover, we will also be focussing on the policy practices employed for social or economic justice. The program will aslo provide an opportunity for participants to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to undergraduate students, master students, doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, young industry professionals and early career faculty (within 7 years of PhD) from both industry and academia.However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 25 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire week-long program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2022/delhi/apply) are due 4th April, 2022.
