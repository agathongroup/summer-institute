# Schedule

Our tentative schedule can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eSt7cD8EGJwEfJutRwfVJX6Dhh0ksux27qV5HAc_lHc/edit?usp=sharing). Our program focuses on causal inference from observational data and text analysis. Moreover, we will invite guest speakers to provide an overview of social statistics, and state-of-the-art developments in statistics, machine learning, and social sciences.
