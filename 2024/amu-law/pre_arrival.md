# Pre-arrival

The Summer Institute will bring together people from many fields and backgrounds. To make the most of our time together, you should"

- familiarise yourself with the basics of Python,
- Prepare your computing environment.


## Learn the basics of Python

The programming work presented at SICSS-AMU 2024 will use Python. Therefore, it would be easier to participate if you know the basics of Python programming. You are welcome to take an online course of your choice, e.g:
- [Learn Python 3 from codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3),
- [Introduction to Python from sololearn.com](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-introduction).

In addition, Chris Bail has created an online training programme for SICSS participants worldwide [SICSS Boot Camp](https://sicss.io/boot_camp). Please note that these training materials use R instead of Python.

## Computing environment

### Google Colab

Some of the activities will require Python coding. For convenience of our participants, we have decided to use Google Colab for our tutorials (therefore Google account is required).

### Zoom

SICSS-AMU/Law 2024 is a virtual event, and we will use Zoom. You can join Zoom meetings using a phone or computer with a microphone and (ideally) a webcam. This [article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/professional-video-call-from-home/) contains some helpful advice on how to set up your device and space to improve your Zoom experience. (Note: though the article recommends external microphones and webcams, we DO NOT recommend or require that you purchase any equipment to participate in SICSS. In our experience, the microphones and webcams built into most modern laptops and phones are perfectly sufficient).

### Slack

Before participating at SICSS-AMU/Law 2024, you should have an account in the SICSS 2024 Slack workspace.  If you have not used Slack before, you should review these [getting started](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started) materials.  Slack can be hard to use at first, but we've found that it is the best way to enable everyone to collaborate.

### GitHub

Many participants at SICSS use GitHub to collaborate. If you do not yet have one, you should [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you are a student, we recommend that you apply for a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## Office hours

The SICSS-AMU/Law [Teaching Assistants](https://sicss.io/2024/duke/people#teaching_assistants) will host weekly office hours in the form of Zoom meetings. If you are not able to attend during the regularly scheduled office hours or have any questions about office hours, please contact our supervisor of Teaching Assistants (Kamil Szostak, e-mail: kamil.szostak@st.amu.edu.pl).
