From June 17 to June 28, 2024, the Faculty of Law and Administration of Adam Mickiewicz University will host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held completely virtually. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together young scholars interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. A site-specific focus at this partner institute will be **legal science**. Topics covered include (but are not limited to): 

*	Application of statistics and programming in law;
*	Predictive analysis in law using machine learning methods, e.g. prediction of judgements;
*	Automated legal text processing (Legal NLP);
*	Use of large language models in the legal domain.

There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to MA students, graduate students (master and doctoral programs), postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/amu-law/apply) are due 30 April 2024 (midnight, GMT+2).
