# Apply

## Eligibility

<p align='justify'>Participation is restricted to Postgraduate students (MSc, Ph.D.), early-career University Faculty, and Industry Professionals with an interest in applying data science techniques to addressing pressing social problems. However, while there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment, due to limited resources for logistics, participation may be restricted to participants living within Southern Nigeria. About 15 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire one-week program.</p>

<p align='justify'>The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.</p>

<p align='justify'>We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions:</p>
<p align='justify'>(1) Research and teaching in the area of computational social science </p>
<p align='justify'>(2) Contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others</p> 
<p align='justify'>(3) Likelihood to benefit from participation</p> 
<p align='justify'>(4) Likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants</p> 
<p align='justify'>(5) Potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.</p>

<p align='left'><b>Application Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>

<p align='left'><b>Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?</b></p>

<p align='justify'>Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Calabar, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.</p>

<p align='left'><b>Can I participate in SICSS-Calabar if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?</b></p>

<p align='justify'>No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.</p>
