# Apply   

### Eligibility

Participation is restricted to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty interested in computational social science. However, no restrictions are based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 20 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. 

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching interests in the area of computational social science, 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others, 3) likelihood to benefit from participation, 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.    

### How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: 1) A letter of application (no more than 500 words) that summarizes your research interests, your achievements, and potential future projects, and 2) Your CV.

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by 11:59 pm on May 30, 2024 (EST).** All application materials must be submitted through [this online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbKGSz7Ep2VYIThMDUMCblW7CriDXqZiwq7xk6zMJPiUXVIg/viewform). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to sicss.uf@gmail.com or jieun.shin@ufl.edu    

### Application Frequently Asked Questions

- Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Florida, and then if you are not accepted, you can apply to one of the other locations if there is a later deadline. However, you can only have applications under review at one location simultaneously.

- Can I participate in SICSS-Florida if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year, we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
