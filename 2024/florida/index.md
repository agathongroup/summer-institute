From July 1 to July 12, 2024, the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science will be held in person at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). The Summer Institute aims to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). The SICSS-Florida focuses on social media data, text analysis, data wrangling, networks, and ethics. 

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20  participants will be invited, and participants are expected to attend and fully participate in the two-week program.

Application materials are due May 30, 2024. Inquiries may be sent to uf@sicss.net or jieun.shin@ufl.edu
