  Generate data to feed to lunr.

  It would be nice to have a pregenerated server-side lunr index rather than feeding raw data here
  and having lunr generate it in-browser. GH Pages does not support custom plugins so doing so would
  involve some additional custom build steps either to build the Jekyll site ourselves (rather than
  the built-in GH Jekyll support we get for free, OR to run a custom build command, similar to
  generating people search data, to generate the lunr index.

  As compared to the people data, however, our video data lives primarily in Markdown files, which
  makes adding new files easy. A custom build command would need to consume the markdown files
  somehow so that it could generate the lunr index.

  The below code creates a VIDEO_LISTING object that uses data from the site configuration's custom
  `video_listing` variable. It will contain:
    - ref: the name of the aspect of each video to be used as the unique identifier
    - fields: the video fields to search using keyowrd search
    - data: a JS object created by iterating each video and plucking out only the keys that we need
      (the ref and fields from above)

  The end result is an array of JS objects that contain all of the data that Lunr will read. If we
  need more lunr search factors, those can be added to config.yml (so that they will be generated
  here).

  Generate a list of keys we need from each video. Start with the search keys, then iterate the
  filter keys and add those to the list, one at a time. These will be used as the fields that lunr
  indexes. Finally, add the ref itself, so that it's included in the JSON data that lunr consumes.

  NOTE: we could use the `| concat` filter instead of iterating, if we were using Jekyll > 4.
